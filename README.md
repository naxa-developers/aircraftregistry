**Update July 2019**: **This is a maintained fork of the [GUTMA Registry](https://github.com/gutma-org/droneregistry) that uses OAuth Tokens to protect the endpoints**

## Aircraft Registry Sandbox

This is a sandbox for working on a interoperable drone registry. It has three main things, you can start in the order below: 

1. [Registry Landscape Whitepaper](https://github.com/gutma-org/droneregistry/blob/master/documents/registration-white-paper.md)
2. Interoperatble API Specification, the technical specification for a registry. You can see the API specification and explore API endpoints at [https://droneregistry.herokuapp.com](https://droneregistry.herokuapp.com) 
3. A working API with all endpoints and sample data for you to explore [https://droneregistry.herokuapp.com/api/v1/](https://droneregistry.herokuapp.com/api/v1/)

## Contribute

You can open issues to this repository, review the Landscape document to review the background and look at open issues to look at the current work in progress.
